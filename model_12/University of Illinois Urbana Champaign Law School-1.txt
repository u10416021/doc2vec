1.5 : Literally made me rethink my decision to come to the school, but other professors are not only more interesting but more merciful that she is. She comes off as willing to help and and happy to assist, but when you do what she requests you improve upon, she lends you absolutely no credence. If you get her for RHET 105, transfer professors.
1.0 : Several people dropped the class - I should have followed suit. Ridiculously tough (assignments require tons of time more than any other class I've had in law school, and grading is exceptionally hard), and the lectures are incredibly dull.
